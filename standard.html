                    <p>
                        Free-moN attempts to raise-the-bar for N scale modular railroading by specifying standards for
                        bench work, track and digital control that promotes, and even forces, prototypical appearance
                        and operational characteristics. This document contains standards that must be followed to the
                        letter and recommendations, in italics, that have been gathered from various sources.

                    <h2>Objectives</h2>
                    <p>These are the goals that the standards presented here are attempting to achieve as they apply to
                        N scale. Each standard set forth below must satisfy at least one of these goals.</p>
                    <p>The Free-moN standard has the following objectives in mind:</p>
                    <ul>
			    <li>To promote and require <em>hi-fidelity prototypical</em> scale model railroading.</li>
                        <li>To ensure reliable track and electrical operation.</li>
			<li>To encourage <em>visual continuity</em> between modules.</li>
			<li>To encourage a <em>loose</em> association among individuals free from club memberships, dues and
                            titles.
                        </li>
			<li>To keep the standard specifications to a <em>minimum</em> without compromising the previous
                            objectives.

                        This two wire bus is used to power turnout motors that control track switches but it may also be
                        used to power other accessories on modules such as structure lighting, signals, animation, and
                        the like. It normally carries a DCC signal similar to that found on the Track Power bus (a
                        separate booster is recommended to avoid robbing power from trains); however it may carry 16V AC
                        as an alternate, lower cost implementation (but less flexible). Electrical accessories within
                        modules can use the DCC power directly (e.g. to control and power stationary decoders), or
                        rectify and regulate it to DC (e.g. to power lights or electronics). If 16V AC is on this bus it
                        may be used directly or may be rectified and regulated to DC as well. One solution is to use a
                        bridge rectifier like Radio Shack's 276-1146.

                        through. Use color-coded wire matching the wire colors present in the phone jacks
                        (white/green/yellow/black/red/blue is most common). Use minimum 26 ga. solid core wire for
                        sturdy connection to phone jack screw terminals. Add strain relief to the wires near their
                        connections to the phone jacks.

                        Single jack panels for the side connections are acceptable on modules with simple track
                        arrangements (i.e. single main line with one spur). However it is strongly recommended to
                        provide dual jack panels on modules with more complex track arrangements (i.e. passing sidings,
                        yards, multi-track spurs) since more operators will be in those areas at any given time.

                    grassy/sandy terrain. Avoid structures and other details that could obstruct your forearms.

                        Each 8-foot length of module should have one barrier stand per side. A crowd control barrier
                        system consists of stands and ropes. Ropes are 1/4 inch yellow nylon style (available at any
                        hardware store). Stands consist of a base and upright designed for simple construction and
                        setup, and which may be separated for efficient storage and transport. Stand bases are 12”
                        square made from 1” plywood (or equivalent multiple plywood layers). Painting is optional. A
                        hole is centered in the base to accommodate a 1/2 inch white PVC pipe end cap, used to receive
                        the stand upright. Stand uprights press-fit into the base and are 36” tall 1/2 inch white PVC
                        pipe with a PVC “T-junction” mounted on top, through which the nylon rope is threaded. Painting
                        is not allowed - leave uprights white.
