                <h2>N Scale Free-mo</h2>
                <p>The official website for N scale free-mo modular railroading.</p>

                <p>Free-mo is a modular scale railroading standard designed for individual modellers that specifies
                    bench work, track work, scenery and digital control intended to <i>raise-the-bar</i> for scale
                    modular railroading in general
                    and, in this case, for N scale modular railroading.</p>

                <p>The standard promotes, and even forces, prototypical appearance and operations by using a
		<span class="strike">single main line traversing the center of the module</span> <span class="add">single or double tracked mainline running roughly through the middle of the scenery</span> resulting in prototypical
                    point-to-point or loop-to-loop configurations and operation.</p>

		    <h1>The Spirit of Free-mo<span class="add">N</span></h1>

                <p align="left">The following list summarizes the spirit and benefits of free-moN over existing modular
                    N scale standards:

                <ul>
                    <li>Designed to satisfy the needs of the <b>advanced modeler</b> over the needs of the beginner and
                        general public.
                    <li>Incorporates a comfortable working and viewing height for adults of 50" from the floor.
                    <li>Specifies Code 55 rail for the main with a minimum 22" radius and #6 turnouts.
			    <li>Encourages layouts that are optimized for prototypical look and operations<span class="strike"> by specifying a
			    single mainline down the middle of the module</span>.
                    <li>Maximizes flexibility for module design and shape by specifying <u>only</u> the end-plate
                        interface and mainline track standards.
                    <li>Simple end-plate specification allows for easy integration into home layouts.
                    <li>Encourages a <u>loose</u> association among individuals free of club or group requirements,
                        membership, dues, etc.
                    <li>Standardized scenery at the end-plates (to merge visually with adjacent modules).
                    <li>DCC/LocoNet/Digitrax control throughout for maximum flexibility.
                    <li>Rolling stock that meets or exceeds NMRA standards for reliability.
                </ul>

                <p>These standards allow for module construction that is free form
                    between the end-plates resulting in flexible and adaptable layout
                    configurations to fit any available space.</p>

                <h1><a target='_blank' href="standard.html">The Standard</a></h1>
                <p>The Free-moN standard was created by <b>Wesley Steiner</b> in 2002 and published in early 2004.
                    It is actively maintained by the Free-moN Steering Commitee and the
                    <a target='_blank' href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/free-mon">Free-moN</a>
                    Google group (formerly a Yahoo! Group).
                    Come join the discussions and see what is developing.
                    Many participants across the country and around the world are building modules and operating
                    free-moN layouts.
